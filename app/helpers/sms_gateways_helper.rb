  # written). When not in production, a different class is used which is supposed to be a semi-functional one used for
  # testing.

  #   in production, a new instance of MysenderGateway is returned
  #   in testing and development, a new instance of MockMysenderGateway is returned if it's a defined class,
  #     otherwise a new instance of MockClickatellGateway is returned
