Your SIM Nigeria Database Information

Dear SIMers,

Please take a minute to review the information we have for you on the SIM Nigeria 
database. We're trying to make sure everything is accurate. Contact information is
particularly important since in case of crisis or emergency we need to be able
to contact you. 

If you are not an SIM member then you are receiving this because you're considered
to be under the SIM "umbrella" in some way. If that is incorrect, please let us know.

Confidentiality

Information marked with an asterisk "*" could appear in the SIM Nigeria directory, 
calendars, or other lists. You may request your email, phone numbers, and Skype 
name to be private if you wish. Other contact information may appear in the directory.
The remainder of the information here will not be available except through the SIM 
Nigeria administration.
