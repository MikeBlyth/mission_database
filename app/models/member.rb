  #== Relate the Family to the newly-created or updated member
  # This is a bit tricky because member and family are related in two ways.
  # * A member BELONGS to a family through family_id (everyone belongs to a family)
  # * A family BELONGS to a member through :head_id  (a family belongs to the head of the family)
  # When creating a new member, the user should be able to assign him/her to an existing family.
  # If that is not done, then the new member should constitute his own family 
  # So the logic of what we're doing in before_ and after_save is:
  # 1) If the member does not have an existing one
  #    - save the new family record with a DUMMY head_id since we don't know the member's id yet
  #    - relate the member to the new family through self.family_id = my_own_family.id
  #    - make the member head of his/her own family
