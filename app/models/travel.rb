  # country. Travel records are matched (arrival-departure) based on member id or, if none, the other_travelers.
  # This means that the results will be incorrect when the people arriving are not exactly the same as 
  # those departing. Even a husband arriving with his wife, but then departing alone, will probably be
  # interpreted as the wife leaving as well. The whole scheme needs to be rethought if it's going to be
