#msg-followup
  %p.note
    Note: Message sending is still experimental and few options are working.
    Be sure to follow up any messages you send with this system, and do not
    assume that they are being delivered reliably (yet).
  %p
    This form is for sending a follow-up for message #{@id}:
  %blockquote
    #{to_local_time(@record.created_at)}: #{@record.body[0..200]} #{'...' if @record.body.size > 200}
  %p
    This follow-up message will be sent <em>only</em> to people who did not receive (or respond to) 
    the original message #{@id}. You can repeat part of the message and or remind people to
    respond.
