# This module provides a method check_authentication which simply checks that a given controller blocks access
# to :new, :edit, :show, :update, and :destroy when a user is not signed in, but allows access when they are
# signed in. Since it's all sort of a modular, single function (authentication), the method does NOT 
# create the object or sign-in the user for each test, it just does them all in sequence. Violates some
# testing principles but keeps things really simple in the spec files. 
#
# I can't remember where this came from! I think Nick Hoffman?
